To start hacking:

* Fork the repo (i.e. create a server-clone), and then clone your fork (using the `hg clone` command) to create a local Kojo workspace.
* Make sure you have Java 6 on your path. You need Java 6 to build Kojo.  You can run Kojo with Java 6, Java 7, or Java 8.
    * [Download JDK 1.6][1] (if you don't already have it).
* Copy javaws.jar and deploy.jar from your jre/lib directory into the lib directory in your Kojo workspace. These jar files are required to compile the Kojo Webstart launcher
* Run './sbt.sh clean package' to build Kojo
* Run './sbt.sh test' to run the Kojo unit tests
* Run './sbt.sh run' to run Kojo (use net.kogics.kojo.lite.DesktopMain as the main class)
* Run './sbt.sh eclipse' or './sbt.sh gen-idea' to generate project files for Eclipse or IDEA (you should be able to do something similar for Netbeans after installing the sbt-netbeans plugin). Import the newly generated project into your IDE, and start hacking! For running Kojo from within the IDE, the main class is net.kogics.kojo.lite.DesktopMain. For debugging, the main class is net.kogics.kojo.lite.Main 

**Eclipse Notes**:
You need to tweak the Eclipse project generated by sbt. Right-click on the project in Eclipse, bring up *Properties*, go to *Java Build Path*, and then go to *Libraries*. Remove the *Scala Library* and *Scala Compiler* containers, and add the Scala library and compiler jars (from your local Scala install, or cached sbt jars). Your project *Libraries* should now contain the following Scala jars:

* scala-library.jar
* scala-compiler.jar
* scala-reflect.jar
* scala-actors-xx.jar
* scala-parser-combinators-xx.jar
* scala-xml-xx.jar
* scala-swing-xx.jar
 
Also make sure that the *JRE System Library* used by the project is at the JDK 1.6 level.
