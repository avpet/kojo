To start hacking:

Make sure you have Java 6 on your path. You need Java 6 to build Kojo (there's one location in the Kojo source tree that does not compile with java 7). You can run Kojo with either Java 6 or Java 7.

Copy javaws.jar and deploy.jar from your jre/lib directory into the lib directory in your Kojo workspace. These jar files are required to compile the Kojo Webstart launcher

Run './sbt.sh clean package' to build Kojo

Run './sbt.sh test' to run the Kojo unit tests

Run './sbt.sh run' to run Kojo (use net.kogics.kojo.lite.DesktopMain as the main class)

Run './sbt.sh eclipse' or './sbt.sh gen-idea' to generate project files for Eclipse or IDEA (you should be able to do something similar for Netbeans after installing the sbt-netbeans plugin). Import the newly generated project into your IDE, and start hacking! For running Kojo from within the IDE, the main class is net.kogics.kojo.lite.DesktopMain. For debugging, the main class is net.kogics.kojo.lite.Main 

Eclipse Notes: You need to tweak the Eclipse project generated by sbt - right-click on the project in Eclipse, bring up 'Properties', go to 'Java Build Path', and then go to 'Libraries'. Remove the Scala Library and Compiler containers, and add the Scala library and compiler jars (from your local Scala install, or cached sbt jars).
